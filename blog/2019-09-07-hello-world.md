## Who Am I?

I am Kevan Yang from [Martinique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique) (small French Department island), and this is my first blog in my life. I'm not a person that likes writingðŸ˜….
I'm currently studying [Computer Programming & Analysis at Seneca College](https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/CPA.html).
The reason I am taking OSD600 is that it is a challenging class, with the freedom to code. I also wanted to have some experience in open source development and meet some developers to share my passion with.

## Currently

I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, with the pandemic situation I did not go anywhere.
I mostly use my free time to code and learn, for most of my projects, I use [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Open source repo

The trending repository I have chosen is the [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react). It is because the web3 to have a new way to login, it allows to login with crypto. This allows us to control our private data and decentralize our data. The data will be store in the blockchain which increases security. This repo is kind of like a React wrapper for web3. Which makes it much more simple to build a modern ethereum app.

Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
